**"Protomorph BG"** is a tool, that will help board game designers to prototype games components(cards, tiles, boards etc.) and save them as a project. It will also have layouts mechanisms, to layout components for printing on standard paper formats and export entire project to PDF or other formats. Will be available for Windows/Linux/OSX (I hope :))
